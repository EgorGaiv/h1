<p>1) I had a chance to get acquainted with the Darknet diaries. I listened to several episodes and I can say that the material is presented quite interstingly and I have never heard anything like it before. the episodes mentioned above describe cybercrime and its manifestations in modern realities. Personally, I liked the episode, which tells about the negligence and careless attitude to children's watches, about how easily the attacker bypassed the security system and, instead of selling the received data or getting money from it in other ways, decided to demand that the manufacturer's company improve their cyber security. I was struck by the availability and ease of obtaining personal information from such services, because now people use applications and programs that collect personal data, the same data is transferred to client bases and cloud services, which hackers are already trying to get access to. Naive users are not even aware of how much these applications know about them and it is sad.</p>

<p>2) Cybersecurity is a type of information security. Protection of technical systems from penetration and theft, hacking or blocking of electronic data.</p>

<p>3) To ensure proper and confident cyber protection, I would recommend:</p>

<p>1 Use effective technical means of protection:</p>
<p>-Latest anti-virus protection systems with built-in isolated environment.</p>
<p>-Automated tools for analyzing security and identifying vulnerabilities in software.</p>
<p>-VPN</p>

<p>2 Protect your data:</p>
<p>-Do not store sensitive information in the clear or in the public domain.</p>
<p>-Use different accounts and passwords to access different resources.</p>
<p>-Use two-factor authentication where possible, such as to protect privileged accounts.</p>

<p>3 Control the security of systems:</p>
<p>-Timely update the software used as patches are released.</p>
